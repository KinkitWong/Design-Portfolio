			<h1> A B O U T &nbsp; M E </h1>

				<p> I am a undergraduate design engineer at the University of Bath. Ever since a young age, I have loved activities where my creativity is stretched to its limits. Once I have found a task to extend my creative thought, I become obsessed in improving my skills to complete that task to my highest capability. Tasks such as choreographing pieces for hip hop dance competitions to coding this very website. This obsessive personality of mine may sometimes be considered pedantic, however I believe this mindset is what makes me a great design engineer. </p>

						I have both studied and applied many design practices such as 'User Centered Design' and 'Disruptive Design' techniques throughout my University life. I have learnt to apply these methods in real life scenarios both inside and outside of University.

						I have developed manufactuing skills and understanding of the accompanying constraints. Hence, I understand what is possible and realistic, grounding my design in reality. I am highly capably of using centre lathes, milling machines, hand tool and sand casting. These attributes can be seen in the my prototyping skills.

				<p> One of my favourite hobbies is Break and Urban dance. I have been committee for the 'BURBAN' dance society (Break and Urban) at the University of Bath for four years and choreographed numerous award winning pieces for the society. Below is one of my latest pieces. </p>
