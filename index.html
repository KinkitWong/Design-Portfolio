			<h1> A B O U T &nbsp; M E </h1>

				<p> I am a undergraduate design engineer at the University of Bath. Creativity and manufacturing skills is what I'm best known for. Generating unique, better solution to problems and creating working products from cradle to grave is what I am trained to do. I have dreamed of becoming a respected, successful product design engineer ever since studying GCSE Design and Technology. I hope, from exploring my design portfolio, you see my love for design and engineering. </p>

				<p> One of my favourite hobbies is Break and Urban dance. I have been committee for the 'BURBAN' dance society (Break and Urban) at the University of Bath for four years and choreographed numerous award winning pieces for the society. Below is one of my latest pieces. </p>
